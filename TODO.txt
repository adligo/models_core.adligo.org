Issues;
1) LDAP entities do not generally have a version number,
so optimistic locking is generally accomplished by comparing all the fields
in the LDAP entity.  However it is still slightly confusing to have a null Version
number in a object which doesn't have a version number on disk.
Also this creates a issue with history classes as the version is in the 
VersionedLongIdentifier AND the class it self.
  I have solved this by splintering the classes as follows;
  This example will eventually spread across the models projects;
  
  Organization  (no version number)
  			VersionedOrganization (wraps VersionedOrganizationMutant)
  OrganizationMutant (no version number)
    		VersionedOrganizationMutant (extends OrganizationMutant adds version)
